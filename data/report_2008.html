<a name="introduction"></a>
<h2>The 2008 Annual Disability Status Report</h2>
<p>The Annual Disability Status Reports provide policy makers, disability advocates, reporters, and the public with a summary of the most recent demographic and economic statistics on the non-institutionalized population with disabilities. They contain information on the population size and disability prevalence for various demographic subpopulations, as well as statistics related to employment, earnings, household income, veterans service-connected disability and health insurance. Comparisons are made to people without disabilities and across disability types. Disability Status Reports and other statistics are available for each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico at <a href="http://www.disabilitystatistics.org">www.disabilitystatistics.org</a>.</p> 

<p>The Status Reports primarily look at the working-age population because the employment gap between people with and without disabilities is a major focus of government programs and advocacy efforts. Employment is also a key factor in the social integration and economic self-sufficiency of working-age people with disabilities.</p>

<p>The estimates in the 2008 Disability Status Report are based on American Community Survey (ACS) data ï¿½ a US Census Bureau survey designed to replace the Decennial Census long form. See the ACS User Guide on <a href="http://www.disabilitystatistics.org">www.disabilitystatistics.org</a> for additional information on the ACS.</p> 

<p>In 2008 the US Census Bureau made a number of significant changes to the ACS. These changes included an entirely new set of disability questions as described on the following page. Changes made to other 2008 ACS questions, including those regarding employment status and the number of weeks worked in the past 12 months (used to calculate full-time/full year employment status), also may have an impact on the results in this report. Because of these changes, comparisons should not be made with previous status reports or estimates.  For a summary of all changes to the ACS 2008 survey see the following Census Bureau document: <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/SummaryResultsACS2006ContentTest.pdf">http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/SummaryResultsACS2006ContentTest.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>The estimates in these reports are based on responses from a sample of the population and may differ from actual population values because of sampling variability and other factors. As a result, differences between the estimates for two or more groups may not be statistically significant.</p>

<h2>2008 ACS Disability Questions</h2>
<p>A number of major changes were made to the ACS disability questions in 2008. The US Census Bureau made these changes to better identify specific portions of the population of persons with disabilities, and to more clearly define disability as a functional limitation that may increase a person's risk of participation limitation. These changes mean that the population of persons with disabilities identified in 2008 is different from that identified in previous years, and the results should not be compared.</p>

<p>Below are the disability questions used in the 2008 ACS. Note that the Census Bureau refers to each of the individual types as "difficulty" while in this report the term "disability" is used.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hearing Disability</strong> <em>(asked of all ages):</em><br/>
16a. Is this person deaf or does he/she have serious difficulty hearing?</li>
<li><strong>Visual Disability</strong> <em>(asked of all ages):</em><br/>
16b. Is this person blind or does he/she have serious difficulty seeing even when wearing glasses?</li>
<li><strong>Cognitive Disability</strong> <em>(asked of persons ages 5 or older):</em> <br/>
17a. Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, does this person have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions?</li>
<li><strong>Ambulatory Disability</strong> <em>(asked of persons ages 5 or older):</em><br/>
17b. Does this person have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?</li>

<li><strong>Self-Care Disability</strong> <em>(asked of persons ages 5 or older):</em></li>
17c. Does this person have difficulty dressing or bathing?</li>
<li><strong>Independent Living Disability</strong> <em>(asked of persons ages 15 or older):</em><br/>
18. Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, does this person have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor's office or shopping?</li>
</ul>

<h3>The major changes from the previous ACS disability questions are:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Duration of limitation was removed and the term "serious" is used to focus on longer term/more severe impairments.</li>
<li>Employment Disability question is no longer asked.</li>
<li><strong>Vision</strong> and <strong>Hearing Disabilities</strong> (was Sensory Disability) are now two separate questions and include children under the age of 5.</li>
<li><strong>Cognitive Disability</strong> (was Mental Disability):  dropped "learning" as an activity, added the activity "making decisions."</li> 
<li><strong>Ambulatory Disability</strong> (was Physical disability) is now limited to mobility related activities; "reaching, lifting, or carrying" activities dropped.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Care Disability</strong> (was Self-Care disability): no longer includes phrase "Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition." The new question is limited to dressing and bathing activities, and the "getting around inside the home" activity is dropped.</li>
<li><strong>Independent Living Disability</strong> (was Go-Outside-Home disability): dropped both the time restriction "lasting 6 months or more" and the phrase "Outside the home."</li>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>New Features and Notes</h2>

<h3>New Features</h3>
<p><strong>Additional Topics:</strong> Two new topics of special interest to disability were added to the revised 2008 ACS and have been included in the 2008 Disability Status Report:  health insurance coverage and veteran's service-connected disability rating. As the two new sensory disability questions (visual and hearing disabilities) are asked of children ages 4 and under, estimates for this age group are included in this report.</p>

<h3>Further Notes</h3>
<p><strong>Puerto Rico:</strong> A Puerto Rico Disability Status Report, based on the parallel 2008 Puerto Rico Community Survey, is available again this year. However, please note that the Puerto Rico sample is not included in any U.S. population estimates included in these reports.</p>

<p><strong>Group Quarters:</strong> In 2006, the ACS began surveying the group quarters population. We include the non-institutionalized group quarters population, but due to small state level sample sizes exclude the institutionalized group quarters population (see <a href="#glossary">glossary</a>) in the Disability Status Reports.</p> 

<p><strong>Margin of Error (MOE):</strong> As in last year's report we provide the 90% MOE to better illustrate sampling variability. See the glossary entry for more information on this topic.</p> 
<p><strong>Glossary:</strong> As in previous years, we provide a comprehensive glossary at the back of this report defining the terms used in the Disability Status Report. (see <a href="#glossary">glossary</a>.)</p> 
<p>Note: According to the Census Bureau, estimates based on the ACS Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) file may differ slightly from the ACS summary tables produced by the Census Bureau because they are subject to additional sampling error and further data processing operations. Please see <a href="http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/edi/disabilitystatistics/faq.cfm#Q4">http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/edi/disabilitystatistics/faq.cfm#Q4</a> for further information.</p>

<h2>Veterans Service-Connected Disability Rating</h2>

<div class="sideBox">
<div class="sideBoxEntry">Veterans with a Service-Connected Disability <span class="number">16.9%</span></div>
</div>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This section presents the percentage of non-institutionalized working-age (ages 21 to 64) civilian veterans reporting a service-connected disability rating in the United States. The 2008 American Community Survey (ACS) asks if the veteran has a service-connected disability, and if so, what their rating is (0-100%). A "service-connected" disability is one that has been determined by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as being a result of disease or injury incurred or aggravated during military service. Note that a veteran can receive disability compensation for a wide range of conditions, and a veteran with a service-connected disability may not report having one of the six ACS functional or activity limitation disabilities.  For definitions of terms, <a name="#glossary">see Glossary</a>.</p> 

<h3>Quick Statistics</h3>
<ul>
<li>In 2008, there were 13,102,700 working-age civilian veterans in the US, of whom 2,217,000 had a VA service-connected disability.</li>
<li>In 2008, the percentage of working-age civilian veterans in the US with a VA service-connected disability was 16.9  percent.</li>
<li>In 2008, 396,700 working-age civilian veterans in the US had the most severe service-connected disability rating (70 percent or above).</li>
<li>In 2008, 17.9 percent of the working-age civilian veterans in the US who had a service connected disability had a service-connected disability rating of 70 percent or above.</li>

<h2>Glossary</h2>

	<a name="1"></a><h4>Actively Looking for Work</h4>
	<p>A person is defined as <u>ACTIVELY</u> looking for work if he or she reports looking for work during the last four weeks.</p>

	<a name="2"></a><h4>Ambulatory Disability</h4>
	<p>This disability type is based on the question (<em>asked of persons ages 5 or older</em>): Does this person have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?</p>

	<a name="3"></a><h4>Base Population (Base Pop.)</h4>
	<p>The estimated number of individuals upon which the calculation is based. (For percentages, this is the denominator).</p> 
</p>

	<a name="25"></a><h4>Cognitive Disability</h4>
	<p>This disability type is based on the question (<em>asked of persons ages 5 or older</em>): Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, does this person have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions?</p>

	<a name="4"></a><h4>Disability and Disability Types</h4>
	<p>The ACS definition of disability is based on six questions. A person is coded as having a disability if he or she or a proxy respondent answers affirmatively for one or more of these six categories.
<ul>

<li><em><u>Hearing Disability</u> (asked of all ages):</em> Is this person deaf or does he/she have serious difficulty hearing?</li> 
<li><em><u>Visual Disability</u> (asked of all ages)</em>: 
Is this person blind or does he/she have serious difficulty seeing even when wearing glasses?</li> 
<li><em><u>Cognitive Disability</u> (asked of persons ages 5 or older)</em>: 
Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, does this person have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions?</li>
<li><em><u>Ambulatory Disability</u></em> (asked of persons ages 5 or older):
Does this person have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?</li>

<li><em><u>Self-care Disability</u> (asked of persons ages 5 or older)</em>:
Does this person have difficulty dressing or bathing?</li>
<li><em><u>Independent Living Disability</u> (asked of persons ages 15 or older):</em>
Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, does this person have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctorâs office or shopping?</li>
</ul></p>

	<a name="5"></a><h4>Earnings</h4>
	<p>Earnings are defined as wages, salary, commissions, bonuses, or tips from all jobs including self-employment income (NET income after business expenses) from own nonfarm businesses or farm businesses, including proprietorships and partnerships.</p>

	<a name="6"></a><h4>Education</h4>
	<p>Our definition is based on the responses to the question: "What is the highest degree or level of school this person has completed? If currently enrolled, mark the previous grade or highest degree received." Our category "high school diploma/equivalent" includes those marking the ACS option "Regular high school diploma â GED or alternative credential." Our category "Some college/Associate's degree" includes those marking the ACS options: some college credit, but less than 1 year of college credit; one or more years of college credit but no degree, or "Associate's degree (for example: AA, AS)." Our category "a Bachelor's or more" includes those marking the ACS options: "Bachelor's degree (for example: BA, BS)"; "Master's degree (for example: MA, MS, MEng, MEd, MSW, MBA)"; "Professional degree (for example: MD, DDS, DVM, LLB, JD)"; or "Doctorate degree (for example: PhD, EdD)." Note in 2008 changes were made to some of the response categories and the layout of this question.</p>

	<a name="7"></a><h4>Employment</h4>
	<p>A person is considered employed if he or she is either 
<ol type="a">
<li>âat workâ: those who did any work at all during the reference week as a paid employee  (worked in his or her own business or profession, worked on his or her own farm, or worked 15 or more hours as an unpaid worker on a family farm or business) or</li>
<li>âwith a job but not at workâ: had a job but temporarily did not work at that job during the reference week due to illness, bad weather, industrial dispute, vacation or other personal reasons. The reference week is defined as the week preceding the date the questionnaire was completed.</li>
</ol></p>

	<a name="28"></a><h4>Employment Rate</h4>
	<p><p>The employment rate is calculated by dividing the number of persons employed by the number of persons in that population.<p>
<p>** Note that the unemployment rate cannot be calculated using the employment rate:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The employment rate is the percentage of all persons who have a job.</li>
 <li>The unemployment rate is the percentage of persons in the labor force who do not have a job but are actively looking for work. The labor force includes people who have a job, are on layoff, or who actively searched for work in the last four weeks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please see http://www.disabilitystatistics.org/faq.cfm#Q6 for more information on unemployment rate calculation and its implications.</p></p>

	<a name="8"></a><h4>Full-Time/Full-Year Employment</h4>
	<p>A person is considered employed full-time/full-year if he or she worked 35 hours or more per week (full-time) and 50 or more weeks per year (full-year). The reference period is defined as the year preceding the date the questionnaire was completed. Note: this does not signify whether a person is eligible for fringe benefits. The question and response categories regarding weeks worked per year was changed in 2008.</p>

	<a name="9"></a><h4>Group Quarters (GQ)</h4>
	<p>A GQ is a place where people live or stay that is normally owned or managed by an entity or organization providing housing and/or services for the residents. These services may include custodial or medical care as well as other types of assistance, and residency is commonly restricted to those receiving these services. People living in group quarters are usually not related to each other. Group quarters include such places as college residence halls, residential treatment centers, skilled nursing facilities, group homes, military barracks, correctional facilities, and workers' dormitories. See the definitions of institutional GQs and non-institutional GQs for more information. In addition, a description of the types of group quarters included in the 2008 ACS is located on the U.S. Census Bureau's Web site at <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/2008_ACS_GQ_Definitions.pdf">www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/<br/>2008_ACS_GQ_Definitions.pdf</a>.</p>

	<a name="10"></a><h4>Health Insurance Coverage</h4>
	<p>Is based on the following question: Is this person CURRENTLY covered by any of the following types of health insurance or health coverage plans? Mark "Yes" or "No" for EACH type of coverage in items a â h.
<ol type="a">
<li>Insurance through a current or former employer or union (of this person or another family member)</li>
<li>Insurance purchased directly from an insurance company (by this person or another family member)</li> 
<li>Medicare, for people 65 and older, or people with certain disabilities</li> 
<li>Medicaid, Medical Assistance, or any kind of government-assistance plan for those with low incomes or a disability</li> 
<li>VA (including those who have ever used or enrolled for VA health care)</li>
<li>TRICARE or other military health care</li> 
<li>Indian Health Service</li> 
<li>Any other type of health insurance or health coverage plan â Specify (Note: âOther typeâ  were recoded into one of the categories a-g by the Census Bureau)</li>
</ol></p>

	<a name="11"></a><h4>Hearing Disability</h4>
	<p>This disability type is based on the question <em>(asked of all ages)</em>: Is this person deaf or does he/she have serious difficulty hearing?</p>

	<a name="12"></a><h4>Hispanic or Latino Origin</h4>
	<p>People of Hispanic or Latino origin are those who classify themselves in a specific Hispanic or Latino category in response to the question, "Is this person Spanish/Hispanic/Latino?" Specifically, those of Hispanic or Latino origin are those who are Cuban; Mexican, Mexican American, Chicano; Puerto Rican; or other Spanish/Hispanic/Latino. Origin may be the heritage, nationality group, lineage, or country of birth of the person or the person's parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States. People who identify their origin as Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino may be of any race.</p>

	<a name="13"></a><h4>Household Income</h4>
	<p>Household Income is defined as the total income of a household including: wages, salary, commissions, bonuses, or tips from all jobs; self-employment income (NET income after business expenses) from own non-farm or farm businesses, including proprietorships and partnerships; interest, dividends, net rental income, royalty income, or income from real estates and trusts; Social Security or Railroad Retirement; Supplemental Security Income; any public assistance or welfare payments from the state or local welfare office; retirement, survivor or disability pensions; and any other regularly received income (e.g., Veterans' payments, unemployment compensation, child support or alimony). Median household income is calculated with the household as the unit of analysis, using household weights without adjusting for household size.</p>

	<a name="14"></a><h4>Independent Living Disability</h4>
	<p>This disability type is based on the question <em>(asked of persons ages 15 or older)</em>: Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, does this person have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctors office or shopping?</p>

	<a name="15"></a><h4>Institutional Group Quarters (GQs)</h4>
	<p>Includes facilities for people under formally authorized, supervised care or custody at the time of enumeration. Generally, restricted to the institution, under the care or supervision of trained staff, and classified as "patients" or "inmates." Includes: correctional, nursing, and in-patient hospice facilities, psychiatric hospitals, juvenile group homes and residential treatment centers.</p>

	<a name="16"></a><h4>Margin of Error (MOE)</h4>
	<p>Data, such as data from the American Community Survey, is based on a sample, and therefore statistics derived from this data are subject to sampling variability. The margin of error (MOE) is a measure of the degree of sampling variability. In a random sample, the degree of sampling variation is determined by the underlying variability of the phenomena being estimated (e.g., income) and the size of the sample (i.e., the number of survey participants used to calculate the statistic). The smaller the margin of error, the lower the sampling variability and the more "precise" the estimate. A margin of error is the difference between an estimate and its upper or lower confidence bounds. Confidence bounds are calculated by adding the MOE to the estimate (upper bound) and subtracting the MOE from the estimate (lower bound). All margins of error in this report are based on a 90 percent confidence level. This means that there is a 90% certainty that the actual value lies somewhere between the upper and lower confidence bounds.</p>

	<a name="17"></a><h4>Non-Institutional Group Quarters (GQs)</h4>
	<p>Includes facilities that are not classified as institutional group quarters; such as college/university housing, group homes intended for adults, residential treatment facilities for adults, workers' group living quarters and Job Corps centers and religious group quarters.</p>

	<a name="26"></a><h4>Not Working but Actively Looking for Work</h4>
	<p>A person is defined as not working but actively looking for work if he or she reports not being employed, but has been looking for work during the last four weeks.</p>

	<a name="18"></a><h4>Number</h4>
	<p>This term appears in the tables; it refers to estimated number of people in the category. (for percentages, this is the numerator).</p>

	<a name="19"></a><h4>Poverty</h4>
	<p>The poverty measure is computed based upon the standards defined in Directive 14 from the Office of Management and Budget. These standards use poverty thresholds created in 1982 and index these thresholds to 2008 dollars using poverty factors based upon the Consumer Price Index. They use the family as the income sharing unit and family income is the sum of total income from each family member living in the household. The poverty threshold depends upon the size of the family; the age of the householder; and the number of related children under the age of 18.</p>

	<a name="20"></a><h4>Race</h4>
	<p>Race categories are based on the question, "[w]hat is this person's race? Mark (X) one or more races to indicate what this person considers himself/herself to be." Responses include the following: White; Black or African-American; American Indian or Alaska Native (print name of enrolled or principal tribe); Asian Indian; Chinese; Filipino; Japanese; Korean; Vietnamese; Other Asian (Print Race); Native Hawaiian; Guamanian or Chamarro; Samoan; Other Pacific Islander (Print Race Below); Some other race (print race below). "Other race" also contains people who report more than one race.</p>

	<a name="21"></a><h4>Sample Size</h4>
	<p>The number of survey participants used to calculate the statistic.</p>

	<a name="27"></a><h4>Self-care Disability</h4>
	<p>This disability type is based on the question (<em>asked of persons ages 5 or older</em>):  17c. Does this person have
difficulty dressing or bathing?</p>

	<a name="22"></a><h4>Supplemental Security Income (SSI)</h4>
	<p><p>A person is defined as receiving SSI payments if he or she reports receiving (SSI) income in the 12 months prior to the survey.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) does not apply to Puerto Rico. SSI is a federal cash assistance program that provides monthly payments to low-income aged, blind, or disabled persons in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the Northern Mariana Islands.</p></p>

	<a name="23"></a><h4>Veteran Service-Connected Disability</h4>
	<p>A disease or injury determined to have occurred in or to have been aggravated by military service. A disability is evaluated according to the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities in Title 38, CFR, and Part 4. Extent of disability is expressed as a percentage from 0% (for conditions that exist but are not disabling to a compensable degree) to 100%, in increments of 10%. This information was determined by the following two part question:
<ol type="a">
<li><strong>Does this person have a VA service-connected disability rating?</strong><br/>
Yes (such as 0%, 10%, 20%, ... , 100%)<br/>
No  <em>SKIP</em> to question 28a</li>
<li><strong>What is this personâs service-connected disability rating?â</strong><br/>
Responses included: 0 percent; 10 or 20 percent; 30 or 40 percent; 50 or 60 percent; 70 percent or higher</li>
</ol></p>

	<a name="24"></a><h4>Visual Disability</h4>
